# Pneumonia_classification

This repository encompasses a project done to classify chest ray images into normal or pneumonia condition based on Deep learning methods.
All the code used and created for data preparation, model development, model hyper optimization and model final testing
are present on this repository.

Keras and CNN algorithms were used to reach the final results. Two different models were developed: the first based 
on a standard loss function and the second based on a weighted loss function that is able to counteract the class imbalance. 

The data used: dataset XP1' (RSNA Pneumonia Challenge 2019 dataset) and dataset XP2 (Kermany et al 2018 childhood pneumonia dataset).

The dataset XP1' and XP2 transformed arrays (pixel arrays and labels) and model weights are shared for download on this google drive link:
